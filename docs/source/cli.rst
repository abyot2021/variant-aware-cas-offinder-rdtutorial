How to use the command-line interface
=====================================

Cas-OFFinder is built upon OpenCL to identify potential off-target sites of CRISPR/Cas-derived RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs).
An OpenCL device is essential for optimal functionality.

Create your environment:


 .. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n crispr

Download requirements.txt and vcf-cas-offinder.py from the command-line interface directory and install all dependencies using the command:


.. code-block:: bash

   pip install â€”no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
