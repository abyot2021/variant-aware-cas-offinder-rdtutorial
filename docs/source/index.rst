Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder
==========================

**Allelic Cas-OFFinder** is a variant aware potential off-target site identifying tool 
based on Cas-OFFinder. Using a reference genome alone to search potential off-target sites
has many drawbacks since it may not contain individual variants, making it challenging for
therapeutic applications. Allelic Cas-OFFinder considers individual variants along with 
reference genome to search potential off-target sites.
